You've heard about Gradle for a long time. Now you're curious, but don't know where to start. It is worth switching?

The objective of this session is to give you a strong introduction to Gradle, demonstrating that it's both a modern and mature build tool.

First and foremost: user interactions: any developer will have interaction with the build tool. We will show how to take advantage of the task based model of Gradle and how to get feedback from your builds as fast as possible.

We will then demonstrate the major advantages of Gradle:

* Conventions and base plugins
* Incrementality (tasks, builds)
* Advanced configuration
* Dependency management
* IDE integration

Last but not least, we will show how to setup a distributed cache, which allows to dramatically reduce build durations, both on CI and locally!

After this session, you will have all the prerequisites to understand what Gradle can provide to you, how its model differs from other build tool, how to improve your build times, or simply improve the quality of your software by defining a build and release process with high quality standards.
