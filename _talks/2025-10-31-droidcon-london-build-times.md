Gradle’s Scalability is a key investment area. Its goal is to allow the build system to grow with the software being built and remain fast in both IDE and CI so that we can provide the best possible developer experience to all Android developers that use Gradle every day. And yes, there’s a lot going on in this area.

Continuous improvements in Gradle help speed up:
* The software developers’ inner loop: code, build, and test Android applications
* The outer loop: Android Studio project sync, and CI, whether stateful or ephemeral

During this session, we would like to cover the main aspects of Gradle performance: work avoidance and parallelism.

In particular, we will discuss:
* What we have shipped, like the Configuration Cache,
* What we have in progress, like Isolated Projects
* And what’s considered next.

As attendees, you will understand how to improve your build performance today and how to prepare your builds for the next benefits as soon as they are available.
