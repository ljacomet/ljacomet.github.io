Gradle has been around for a while as a Java build tool. Its power and expressiveness make it sometimes challenging to approach. And thus the question is: why should I take the time to learn Gradle?

After gaining a basic understanding of Gradle build script for a Java project, we will look into the features that make Gradle shine.

Through work avoidance, parallelisation and caching, you will see how Gradle keeps build time low even for complex projects and how this can significantly impact development workflow for you and your team.

After this session you will understand why the Grade tag line is “Build happiness”!
